                PEP stands for Politically Exposed Person. Someone is considered as a PEP when that person holds a
                senior political or official position. As a financial institution, Mollie is obligated to investigate
                whether a Politically Exposed Person is involved. When creating a Mollie account, you will be asked if
                you, one of your close family members or your business associates are politically exposed. If you answer
                this question with yes, you need to provide us with more information about this.</p>

                    medium of exchange within the PEP ecosystem, allowing users to participate in political campaigns,
                    make
                    donations, and access exclusive political content. The token leverages the security, transparency,
                    and
                    immutability of blockchain to create a fair and inclusive political environment.</p>
